# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an educational repository for the "Fundamentals of AI for Business" course at Ivey Business School, developed by Associate Professor Yasser Rahrovani. It contains case study materials, teaching resources, and academic content for a 10-hour asynchronous course exploring AI as a system embedded in organizations, decisions, and society.

## Repository Structure

- **Proposal/**: Contains the course proposal documents (both PDF and DOCX formats)
- **SME Materials/**: Subject Matter Expert materials organized by module and session
  - **Session 3/**: Case studies including COMPAS algorithm bias analysis (W42647_pws.pdf and W43809_pws.pdf)
  - **Module 1/**: Course materials for foundational AI concepts
- **.claude/**: Claude Code configuration directory with local settings

  - Podcast introduction, Google Colab walkthrough, hands-on exercises
- **Session 2**: ML Techniques (~1.5 hours) 
  - Comic-based cases, CustomGPT simulations, supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement learning

### Module 2: AI Development and Execution  
- **Session 3**: ML Development and Bias (~2 hours)
  - ML bias podcast, CustomGPT exercises, bias reflection
- **Session 4**: AI, Work, and Creativity (~1.5 hours)
  - Avatar cases, automation vs. augmentation exercises

### Module 3: AI and Society
- **Session 5**: Executing and Governing AI (~2 hours)
  - LUMC podcast/case, implementation strategy exercises
- **Session 6**: AI Harms and Snake Oil (~1 hour)
  - Deep learning overviews, predictive vs. generative AI risks

## Key Content Areas

### Machine Learning Bias Case Study
The repository centers around a comprehensive case study examining the COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) recidivism prediction algorithm and the ProPublica vs. Northpointe debate about algorithmic bias.

**Core Materials:**
- W42647_pws.pdf: Main case study on "Machine Learning Bias: Algorithms in the Courtroom"
- W43809_pws.pdf: Teaching note with detailed analysis framework and classroom exercises

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understanding the machine learning development cycle
- Identifying nine types of AI/ML biases across three categories (Data, Algorithm, User)
- Analyzing competing definitions of fairness (outcome vs. procedure fairness)
- Examining bias mitigation strategies and responsibilities

### Three Categories of ML Bias
1. **Data-to-Algorithm Bias**: Measurement, Representation, Aggregation
2. **Algorithm-to-Users Bias**: Learning, User-interaction, Evaluation  
3. **Users-to-Data Bias**: Historical, Deployment, Self-selection

## Course Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
1. Describe fundamentals of AI and ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
2. Apply hands-on understanding of ML development through guided no-code replication
3. Explain the ML development process and evaluate how bias emerges at each stage
4. Analyze how AI transforms work, creativity, decision-making, and automation vs. augmentation
5. Evaluate managerial challenges of AI implementation and cross-functional coordination
6. Recognize ethical risks and societal harms of AI

## Innovative Pedagogical Approaches

The course uses diverse content formats:
- **Podcases**: Audio case studies for accessibility and engagement
- **Comic-based cases**: Visual learning for complex ML concepts
- **CustomGPT simulations**: Interactive AI exercises and reflections
- **Google Colab exercises**: Hands-on, no-code ML experience
- **Video content**: Expert-led conceptual explanations

## Content Guidelines

When working with this repository:

- This is primarily academic/educational content, not production software
- Materials are copyrighted by Ivey Business School and should not be reproduced without permission
- Case studies are designed for classroom discussion and learning purposes
- Content focuses on business implications of AI bias rather than technical implementation
- Teaching materials include detailed statistical analysis and probability calculations

## File Types and Formats

- PDF documents contain case studies and teaching materials
- DOCX files contain course proposals and administrative documents
- No traditional codebase structure (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- No build, test, or deployment processes required

## Working with Course Content

When analyzing or discussing course materials:
- Respect academic integrity and copyright restrictions
- Focus on educational and discussion aspects rather than direct reproduction
- Consider the business/managerial perspective rather than purely technical implementation
- Reference the detailed bias framework and fairness definitions provided in the teaching materials

## Important Notes

- This repository does not contain executable code or software applications
- No programming languages, frameworks, or development tools are used
- Content is designed for business education rather than technical development
- Materials require careful handling due to academic copyright restrictions
