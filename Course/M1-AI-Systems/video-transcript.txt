So what? I'm gonna start, um. So you see my screen?

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,650
Uh, I'm going to go and search Google Colab.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,180
My suggestion is to go with your Gmail. Um, you have access to it.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,540
And this is the Google Colab. And then I press it.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,410
So we're going to go and have a new notebook. Okay.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:29,690
So when you press this notebook, um, it opens an environment that we are going to code here.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,420
What is that? I'm going to explain it to you. Um, this and moments as you see.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,410
Untitled zero dots. So it's an interactive AI poi python and B is notebook.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,530
So interactive Python notebook is not office the environment that interact we write the code.

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,660
So look at here. You can really write the code. If you know Python you can do it exactly as you want to.

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,480
And if you're not you can ask AI to generate the code for you.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:03,380
So um, that's an environment that we do the attribution, uh, write down here whatever you want.

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,280
Um, and you can you see that's like a cell.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,500
Um, you can you can press on this, you can generate the code, you can deleted, you can do whatever you want.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,280
And if you press this, it's going to run the model, okay.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,990
This is an environment that you talk to Jim and on for you for general to understand what you mean or generally explain it to you.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,610
And when you use this, you develop the code.

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,510
And then when the code is develop is going to show up here and then you run it.

19
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,719
Um, one thing some of you may have it in the bottom here, but it doesn't matter if you look at it, you can move it.

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,900
For example, from the layout you can go with the two rows.

21
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,740
So it comes in the bottom. But I prefer always to have it on the side.

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,800
Um, that's a little bit easier for me. Um, but go.

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:02:01,680
As you wish. Right. Okay. Okay. So when we create a new interactive Python notebook, as I just did, you have a kind of a blank and one.

24
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,760
It's a black notebook you need to load the data on. Right? To load the data, you need to go into your drive.

25
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,740
And then you go into the drive you're going to see as you see here.

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,590
Um, in your drive there is a notebook colab folder being created.

27
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:28,009
So if you go here, you will see that you have a notebook and that's going to have a folder and that has an untitled.

28
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,850
And that's exactly you see here, untitled zero is what we have here.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,040
So let's change the name of this to Long Data.

30
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,430
Um, so that's the long data. Uh, this name is change the school here and see whether this has changed.

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,920
Um, and if you refresh is going to change, but you have a long data also CSV.

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,550
Take your CSV file and drag and drop it here.

33
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,860
Okay. Because you need to.

34
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:04,230
And when you put it there it's going to you're going to make that load data mounted um to the to the notebook uh, uh, that you just created.

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,360
You see that that name also changed, uh, uh, and you have it here.

36
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,500
So now we don't have the data. So you press on this. Um, this is the place you need to mount the your data set.

37
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,519
You see this here? Sometimes it doesn't show. Wait a couple seconds.

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,480
It's going to show up. Um, if we go here, you see that there's a sample data, which we have nothing to do with the sample data.

39
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,340
Uh, we need to mount to, uh. But I don't see the drive to be able to see the drive.

40
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,910
You press this, it's going to say connect to the Google Drive.

41
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:42,850
And if you approve that connection, you may get a notification on your email, or you may get a notification on a cell phone and prove it.

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,800
But it takes a couple of seconds to pull up and get a couple of approvals, um, to make sure you're okay.

43
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,910
After the consent, you're going to have access to it. It didn't do show it for me, but it may sure it for you.

44
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,220
Accept it. Uh, read it and accept those files because you're going to see the drive now.

45
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,080
It's my drive. And when I go down, I'll see a Google Colab.

46
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,310
And then you have the Google Colab. Um, you see this, uh, loan data here.

47
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,870
So now you have access to it. Go there and say copy paste, which is the address that could copy you.

48
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,560
You copy the password is and you come here. So the very first thing you do is, uh, load the data.

49
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:36,740
Here for me. You see that? I deliberately take it off the language that it's really like a simple language, not coding language.

50
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,570
And I say, okay, here's the data and here's the address. I copy and pasted this address, you see.

51
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,170
Uh, this is the address that I copied. It's a CSV file.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:54,260
So I talk a simple language through it and it's going to turn it into a code not running it, but it turned into the code that you see the code.

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,900
And then you will decide to run it. Okay. So what we'll do.

54
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,640
Okay. That's the kind of the Python language of it.

55
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,460
Uh, and it gives you the option of accepting but not running or accepting and running.

56
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,390
So you can do that. But even before accepting and running, you can press.

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,150
I mean, let me accept and run and then I'll tell you what it is. But, um, I can explain this.

58
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,450
If you bring the, the, uh, the, the cursor on it, it explains the, the for example, this is display.

59
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,060
It explains how you use it. It gives you some example, but you can also ask it to explain it to you in a simple language.

60
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,549
So you see how it does it. So import pandas.

61
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,940
Pandas is one library that is very much used for the data, uh, data analysis, especially when it's a spreadsheet.

62
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,110
And as PD as PD means, I want to give it a simple name that I keep.

63
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:48,170
Don't keep writing. Pandas. Pandas, pandas. So you see that you name it as PD, you don't understand.

64
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,900
That means panda and it calls for read CSV, which is a function into that library.

65
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,409
As you see, Python is pretty simple. They have develop libraries.

66
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,550
You don't need to develop libraries and you don't need to develop functions within that library.

67
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,390
It has been, uh, tested and improved, and it's constantly being maintained by the community development community.

68
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,410
So we just use it pretty simple. But that's the explanation.

69
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,770
The DF, uh, means dataframe. So it's going to read the CSV and put it in the dataframe.

70
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,560
It's like a bucket for spreadsheet. So it loads all the data into that display and show it to me.

71
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,120
And DF is the dataframe that I just you just loaded the data on.

72
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,770
And the head means just the top five rows and I just want to see it.

73
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,860
Right. So that's what it says. So let's accept and run.

74
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,270
Uh, you can press the run here as well. And that's it. So you see this.

75
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,490
It shows what you have. It's it displays the top five rows zero, one, two, three, four.

76
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,970
And you see the variables inside it okay. So we can take a look.

77
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,540
It's always important to take a look at that. So we have person age.

78
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:01,040
Uh we have the gender female male uh person education masters, high school bachelor and so on.

79
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,980
Income with one decimal, um, employment exper, uh, experience.

80
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,470
But do you eventually see that some of them you may not understand, depending on how do you put the data into a CSV.

81
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,330
So most of the time a good, um, data, uh,

82
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,490
science practice is that you include the middle information about your data sets and you keep that because people come and read it and understand.

83
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,110
For example, somebody may not understand what is the meaning of load into it,

84
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,909
but probably a hunch is it's interest rate for the loan rate and the intent.

85
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,810
Is it personal, is is for medical or education purposes and so on and so forth.

86
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:44,509
So this is a data set that we have. So it's a combination of categorical variable female male master explanation words

87
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,010
rent um and numerical that you see a lot of numerical variables loan amount.

88
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:59,540
And let me scroll to the to the end loan status which is one means yeah it was approved and zero is no, we did not approve that loan.

89
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,080
Uh, whenever you are doing okay. So we imported the data and got this.

90
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,350
So if you do not understand you need you can also prompted.

91
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,250
Here, explain this for me. Or you can press on this.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,209
Um, this. You see that this is data Gen.

93
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,570
I've explained the code for me and it explains everything.

94
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,450
If you understand most of it, then you can just go and, um, explain the parts that you want.

95
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,680
But you see that I actually had it just selected this post.

96
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,669
It only explains this part. So if you don't select part of the text, it's going to explain everything.

97
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,810
But it says this reads CSV is a function from pandas library.

98
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,730
It explains to you what it is if you do it like this. Not a very specific part.

99
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,260
I recently read it and you'll see that it's going to explain everything to you, uh, in terms of what they used for.

100
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,240
So I assume it explains about the panda is about the PD, about the DF.

101
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:05,210
Um, you you go, uh, import pandas as PD means import pandas library, giving it, uh, the alias of PD.

102
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,840
If you don't understand, you can ask someone. What? These pandas useful for?

103
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,469
I don't know what it is. So I asked the question. Very simple. Right.

104
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,010
So you can it's really interactive. Um, like ChatGPT doesn't matter.

105
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,100
It's like a Gemini here. Talk to you, but explain it to you.

106
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,830
It's used for data manipulation and cleaning, data analysis, data loading and saving and so on and so forth.

107
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,870
Okay, so we loaded data and we took a look at the first five rows okay.

108
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,920
What if if I want to know more. So describe.

109
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,680
The data sets for me. Remember that there's a caveat here.

110
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,010
You gave me the data. That's what Jim and I should say.

111
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,769
So you know what you gave me. But it's still.

112
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:58,229
You know that from looking at the data, Gemini has some sense look at correlations, mashing up the numbers and explanations and so forth.

113
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:05,550
Probably come up with. Yes. So you you can use this describe uh, but you always interpret it with a caveat.

114
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,870
So let's see what what what function does it in Python when we simply ask describe a.

115
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,819
So it's going to develop the code for that. Okay. So it involves three lines of codes.

116
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,360
And it explains it actually here as you see it says display the shape of the data frame number of rows and number of columns.

117
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,450
So it's automatically came up with that. You could have asked it directly but then a general ask a general question.

118
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,800
It included this tree. If you have another force type of question you can add it.

119
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,440
But these are the tree. Um, so it displays the DF shape.

120
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,210
That's the function. You can learn the function if you're interested in Python I would um, the other one is the data info,

121
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,960
which is bring you up more of the information about the types of variables.

122
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:57,390
Which one of them is for example integer, which one of them is text, which one is do you have a null uh, um, and missing values in it?

123
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh no. So you get it there. And descriptive statistics.

124
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,969
What is the mean. What is the average, uh, median. What is the, uh, for example, 1,225%.

125
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,760
What is the maximum? What is the minimum. And that's display. Display is like order.

126
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,809
Is it you printed out and DF is in my data frame that you have it displayed it for me.

127
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,220
And that's the function. So let's go one accept all the tree and see what it does.

128
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,600
So the very first one that says explain the shape.

129
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,190
It says it has 45,000 rows and 14 columns.

130
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,139
Right. Uh, we can have a guess of the columns, but we'll see the next one.

131
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:42,180
It brings up the information about a specific variable. So those are the columns column um encoding in Python it starts from zero.

132
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,829
So column zero is person h. We have 45,000 of them.

133
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,110
There's no null in it. So that's great. So it shows the data is clean when it was passed to you, which is great.

134
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,480
Um, just in parentheses. Data cleaning is a very tedious and very important task.

135
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,540
You just skip it because that's not part of the course. Right.

136
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,780
But I want you to know that, uh, and data type is float64 is one type of, for example, numbers.

137
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,530
Um, it's 64, uh, bits, uh, bytes.

138
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:17,490
Um, uh, bits actually um, and object is the character is the tax rate it has for gender.

139
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,570
Education is an object, but income is a float64.

140
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,520
Um, this is integer um 64 and so on and so forth.

141
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:35,249
You probably start guessing um, uh, loan, integer array, interest rate, loan intent, loan percent, percent income.

142
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:42,809
So it's probably a percentage of the amount of loan over the amount of income you have, um, personal credit history length,

143
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,990
which is how many years you have credit history and the credit score, uh, previous loan defaults on file.

144
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,569
Is there any kind of a bad news about the past, um, loans and the loan status?

145
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,500
Right. So it kind of summarizes the different types of data types that we have.

146
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:07,469
This is how much it was kind of amount of capacity, uh, of uh data it takes uh, and describes come in with statistics.

147
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,740
So look at this is statistics is only for numerical variables.

148
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,629
Look at this is all of them 45,000 which there's no missing value mean of them.

149
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,500
Minimum maximum. And so for standard deviation. Oh interesting.

150
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,420
Uh that easily gives us there are some probably outliers that you need to take care of.

151
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:35,010
Somebody with 140 years old person with the employment experience of 125,000 years, asked for the loan and it was approved.

152
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:45,450
Interesting. Um. So anyways, um, we have that and you see that these numbers are also some of them that you may want to point for.

153
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:53,069
You don't have such a thing should be zero and one. So you get a sense of some of the kind of data cleaning that is necessary,

154
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,490
although there's no missing value, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have that.

155
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:05,430
Okay. So if you want a sense of the pixel. So what about if I want to get some visualization and data I want to look at for example?

156
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:14,490
Uh, let me ask it. So what if I want if I want to predict loan status.

157
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:25,620
Um. Give me. Two important visualization to look at, which is good and bad.

158
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,000
It's good that it can create and gives propose something to me.

159
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,569
At the same time, it shows that because on the subject matter, it matter.

160
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,440
Experts. I'm the anchor. I should have an idea what to include or not.

161
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:47,540
So I want to just emphasize that you can't rely on, uh, generative AI to tell you what, what type of, uh, correlation or visualization you need.

162
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,290
But if you just want to show me the power of this. Okay, let's take a look at that.

163
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,580
So you see that it takes a bit of a time and it has some, um, some suggestions.

164
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:10,720
Uh, we can pick one of them and then cancel the rest. But visualize the distribution of loan status, which is generally because this status.

165
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,230
How many? One. How many? Zero. Uh, analyze the relationship between numerical features and loan status.

166
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,650
So, for example, the interest rates and personal income,

167
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,540
that would be interesting to know and analyze the relationship between categorical variables and some of them.

168
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,129
So let's let's get all of them, um, just to get a sense of this.

169
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,220
We're not going to go through all I'm going to skip this. You have a time.

170
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,970
You have a chance to do it yourself and an inquiry strongly to do that.

171
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,390
But it just wants you to see how it works. If you saw I pressed on the run all so it's not going to wait for my approval.

172
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,239
So let's go as it's doing it. So we'll take a look at that.

173
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,920
So if you want to get an explanation anytime you want you press on this and explain it to you.

174
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,500
But some of them I just explain it just imports math plot which is used always for plotting.

175
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,030
Um, so and this is the code for why I'm not going to go through that.

176
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:09,430
If you're interested, go through it yourself. But I'm going to just show you count of the approvals or the rejections and loan status.

177
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,269
It shows like around 35,000 or decline and around 10,000 were approved.

178
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,040
One. Right. Um, then it comes down, looks at this, um, plot.

179
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:33,669
So this is interesting. It shows the one that are approved on average or around 13% interest rate, the ones that are declined or on average 11%.

180
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,170
And that's interesting. And why is that and mean we can come up with a couple of hypotheses.

181
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,920
But again, a subject matter expert can better explain. Is it a bank decision policy is a regulator's policy.

182
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:52,270
If there's this shows that then the interest rate is higher. Banks are feeling comfortable to give more loans or approve more.

183
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,169
The system is uh less. They don't do that. Um, so on.

184
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:03,670
And so there can be a lot of explanations, but you can take a look at different types of, uh, plots that it automatically generated.

185
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,870
And I won't go through that. This is based on the homeownership as an important variable.

186
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:13,540
That can be important. And then we'll stop here okay. So these are some of the interesting variables that we can visualize.

187
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:21,909
Do we have an outlier. Definitely we have an outlier. But I want to go um we have more than a few and in different categories of outliers.

188
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,790
But I just want to give you one example. Um, I want to.

189
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,880
See how players in percent aged.

190
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,790
So let's just take a look on how it calculates.

191
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,180
Again, I don't go through the details, but I just want to show you the power of this and the importance of it.

192
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,830
Right. Um, let me because I think it went well and that's okay.

193
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,440
It put that it forth there. And this one, what is it doing? Um, so it is.

194
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,840
They can see it's going to give us, uh. Let's see. This is the outflow.

195
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,200
This is the boxplot. It shows the output flow this way.

196
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,640
Okay. What about, um. I don't need it this way.

197
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,700
I need. To actually does show.

198
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,270
Some of this shows that some people are over 100.

199
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:27,909
How do I assume people are over 100? Imagine I talk through to my manager when my colleagues and we think that that's obviously wrong.

200
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:42,130
Somebody had done a data entry goes wrong. I can don't start. So we can ask it to tonight draw the data points that has the age of the person.

201
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,420
Over 100. Well, let's say for under 50 years.

202
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,180
So let's see what it does. So again I ask it and say what is the code for that.

203
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:02,709
Right. So we're going to see. So I don't know why it does it on the top.

204
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,670
So then they bring it down. So you see that these cells you can look at it started doing there.

205
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,049
I just brought it down. So this is the explanation of the code for it.

206
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:18,400
So it does. Um so if you look at this it the data frame, it creates a new data frame which is called filter by age.

207
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,680
You see that if you're always in software development and coding, we kind of make it in a way that is understandable.

208
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:32,620
But take a look at it. Right. So the data frame we go with the ones only included the first that the age is over equal to 15 and list and this.

209
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,540
And then we put that in a new data frame. So uh, am I going to do that.

210
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,019
I don't want to do if I cancel it. Right. I keep it as it is.

211
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,410
Let's think about it. We can go and do all of these type of things and the data, and you need to do that in a real project.

212
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,460
Um, okay. We have a lot of categorical variable.

213
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:58,630
Let us a little bit clean the data there. Um number one for numerical do I need to do is scale.

214
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,760
Some of them may be one, two and three. Some of them maybe 4000, 35,000.

215
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,209
And it becomes more difficult to work with. Maybe I need to standardize that.

216
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:14,350
That's fine for categorical. I mean, I do need to turn them into numbers because that's what machine learning understands.

217
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:20,020
So me categorical in two rather than false and true false until we do one actually.

218
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:27,490
So it's the same. But in terms of whether it's a bachelor's degree or somebody has a high school degree, I have to turn it into number.

219
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,809
And then, for example, sometimes I may want to drop some of the variables.

220
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,040
And so so these are a little bit of a data cleaning. Let me go with the categorical variables.

221
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:41,680
Can you show me the categorical variables.

222
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,650
Um tell me how to turn them into numerical.

223
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:55,010
And I don't know I'd have total I'll be there because uh generativity I understand that.

224
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,470
Right. So let's see what it does. Um hmm.

225
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,620
There's a bit of a time. I don't know what they mean. So it's this categorical column.

226
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,650
So it's create a new dataframe. So from the dataframe that we had it selects the data types.

227
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,210
This is a function that it calls in Panda.

228
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:23,339
So dataframe select the types that include object y is that if you go or if you remember when we initially got a report, it says this is object.

229
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,309
If this is object integer a float or numbers, but object is text for example.

230
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,330
Those are categorical. So select stores and prints them and displayed it.

231
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,400
Okay let's do that. We want to take a look at that okay. So categorical variable in the data set.

232
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,010
So even it's in the quotation. It exactly puts that as it as a text as a string.

233
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,639
And then it says what is it. It says. And an index set is percent gender percent education.

234
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,400
These all those ones. Right. And then it tells you okay I can turn them into numerical.

235
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,200
How do you want to do it. There are different types that it can do it a little with the most simple one which is one hot encoding, one hot encoding.

236
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,670
Let me tell you what it does. Imagine we have four categories high school degree, bachelor's degree, graduate degree or PhD.

237
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,250
These are four categories. It it turns that one column to four columns.

238
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:24,479
So rather than one column of education and the text in it, if you have four columns and column one is high school,

239
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,760
column two is, uh, Bachelor and column three is um grad and column for is, for example, PhD.

240
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,110
And whichever one is right, it makes that one, the other one is zero.

241
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,310
Right. And that's the easiest one especially for these type of categories that we use.

242
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,980
I think that's good enough. So I tell you go with one.

243
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,330
Hard coding. So just. Just learn as much as just as all this other stuff.

244
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,159
I don't want to go into details, but the other one, for example, was giving you the kind of A12,

245
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,410
three, four variable, uh, which is a second priority in this situation.

246
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,220
Why? Uh, it's, uh, you can you can dig down.

247
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,700
Um, beyond this. It's beyond this conversation. Okay.

248
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,150
So let's see how d does it. So DF encoder. So it's, um, encoding categorical into a miracle.

249
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,390
Excellent. So it does this, it gets dummy variables zero and one will call false and true.

250
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,170
It goes with false and true which is zero and one. And it prints out DataFrame.

251
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,820
After one hot encoding it displays it and it shows the head of it for you to get a sense, and it shows you the shape of it.

252
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,810
Okay, let's do that. So we do it. Um, so we did it for the whole document.

253
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,810
So the shape of the dataframe now is on on the rather than if you remember it had 14 columns.

254
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,490
Then it turns into 23 columns. And that's okay. And it's actually a good thing for for machine learning algorithm it's easier to interpret this way.

255
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,260
Um, and it just shows the, uh, the, the head of it to, to, to, to to give you a sense,

256
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,209
you look at here, you see that it's loan intent, personal true loan intent, medical false loan intent.

257
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,260
Home improvement false. So for all those are going to be false.

258
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,290
And this is the only one that is true. That's the way we do it. Okay.

259
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,920
That's good. Um, let me ask for the numerical.

260
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:28,110
Do we need to standardize, um, a skill stand or uh, is the numerical variables?

261
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,879
Let me see what it says. You take a look on the data and tells me if they want to develop more.

262
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,370
Or is it really I actually, it's not a very good prompt, but I actually have to say,

263
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,780
if I want to develop a supervised machine learning with a simple algorithm, do I need to standardize it?

264
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,100
But by default we need to do that. Um, it says that's a great question.

265
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,470
Uh, whether or not you need it, it's good to actually go and do it.

266
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,960
So what are the, um, let me let me tell.

267
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:08,160
Um, I am going to use logistic regression, which I'm going to show you later as the algo for.

268
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,660
A predictive assessment. Standardize.

269
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,640
The video for me. In numerical. Okay, let's see what he does.

270
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,390
When I say do it for me, I assume that is going to come up with the code. Okay, so it's excellent choice.

271
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:43,840
Logistic regression is indeed sensitive to the scalar features, and that's actually pretty important.

272
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
Um so that's what it is. So going in to explain it let's go with this.

273
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,630
This is quite complex. Let's see what it means and then go with the whole of it.

274
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,330
Um. And I did it before running.

275
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,020
Let's see what it's going to do with it. Um. Oh, I should run that.

276
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,750
Uh, so sometimes it's good to take a look and see what is.

277
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,530
Yes, you. Let me see you.

278
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,030
Let me ask it again. I'm going to ask you again.

279
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,170
I think I told you I was better off running it and then asking the question of explaining the code for you.

280
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,130
So let me do this and see whether it's kind of okay, now that's better.

281
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,140
So we'll run it. And then ask if you're slightly.

282
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,290
So. To give you a general sense.

283
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:46,390
Um. So I am going to go on to ask you to explain for me.

284
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,990
Before we dive into developing the model, which is the beef.

285
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,840
And in this in this session. Okay. So uh, here's the explanation.

286
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,700
The first part, you see this? I mean, it's half hot even it has hashtag.

287
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,440
It's explanation very short, but it brings in all the numerical columns.

288
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Uh, creates a new encoder last time you had an encoded form.

289
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:19,630
Categorical. This is for numerical. So this one, it only selects the one, not the object with the 4064 an integer 64.

290
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,490
And it puts it there and it removes the long status.

291
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,290
I'll tell you later why. Because and one reason is that because that's the vertical.

292
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,769
But that doesn't need any any standardization positions. You want one.

293
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,360
Right. So it removes that. And that's actually very wise and a good decision.

294
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,709
So it does this. You can see this. It explains any of those variables.

295
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,870
Explain why these two. And then you come down and what it does.

296
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:50,650
Let it go and see what is this function. For example I want to learn about this.

297
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:56,680
That's a function of a standardization. This creates an instance of this and a scalar right.

298
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,960
So it makes it for example you want to go and have a logarithm and it's going to go and do that right.

299
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,040
Um so we do this and we have five rows.

300
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:14,319
It shows the 323 columns. And it did to standardize many of these variables that we have to display the first row.

301
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,410
This is for the display. And you deployed this and it fit and it transformed the data.

302
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,490
If you come here it extreme calculates the mean and standard deviation.

303
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,120
You always need that for standardization. And then it applies.

304
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,480
And it kind of uh makes it standardize okay.

305
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,420
So let's go for I think it was in the 12.

306
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:42,759
He was someplace that it was. Oh okay. That's very it. So let's it actually explains what is the process.

307
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,290
So let me ask you again to make it better. Come on. Accomplished.

308
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:54,400
Now I need the I need to evolve and SML model.

309
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:01,950
Um. With logistic regression or.

310
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,310
I don't know whether that's the best or any suggestion you may have.

311
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,200
What are these steps? That's access.

312
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,250
And that's part of the learning. And I need you to kind of understand this part.

313
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:26,100
What are exactly these steps for, uh, doing the so if this is this or this stuff.

314
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,659
So number one, you split the data. Um, what do I mean by that?

315
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:40,360
You split the data. Um, you have a data frame. You need to separate the target variable or dependent variable, which is only one variable we have.

316
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,830
What is it is the last one, right. It is the I think we have more variables now.

317
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,610
So it's the loan status right. Loan status 011. This guy is the one that you want to predict through your name okay.

318
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,840
And we have all the other variables. So we want to have all the other variables that are x's X12 3 to 22.

319
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,799
And the x 23. It's not x it's going to be y.

320
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,520
That's the predictive um the prediction the variable that we want to predict.

321
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:14,650
And then we, we separate the two. And then what we do is the another point we want to do, which is this guy testing your training.

322
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:21,339
What is that. So imagine you have a data set. You're not going to use all that data to train your algorithm.

323
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,850
Why? Because there's no way to test it. But it's a good one or not.

324
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:32,140
Sometimes you go and it comes up with an algorithm that this predictable, this point 55 this is really not different from flipping the coin.

325
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:38,830
Right? So it's not a good one. Do you want to test it? So having that said, always a statistician data scientist.

326
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,159
We split the data into like 70% of it.

327
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,520
They keep it for training. They keep another 30% for training.

328
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:52,120
They do that right. And then when we do this, we use the training part to train the, uh, the model.

329
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,930
We use logistic regression here as an algorithm that we just adopted.

330
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,339
You don't need to learn the details about it. And then we look at the prediction, we do the prediction.

331
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:07,690
And then we look at the to evaluate it with the test part, with the test uh part of the data set and see whether it's a good one or not.

332
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,810
And that's what we do. And then we finish this, this recording.

333
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,590
So let's do it one by one. And it's fun.

334
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,350
So. If you put us in here. Um, it is splits.

335
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,549
Um, I don't know. I think we did this split up because it it dropped the lone status.

336
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,570
But anyways, it has to create, um, something for it.

337
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:36,760
So let's see this, uh, the scalar or scikit learn is the library that you adopt and you import.

338
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,180
This is a function again embedded into that library.

339
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:48,210
You don't need to reinvent it. Its job is to split any data set you give to it to a training and test it.

340
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,620
Right. So what we do is this is what we do.

341
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,770
So number one we have two splits as I mentioned.

342
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:05,830
Number one separate the features which are xs x one to x 22 and the target variable which we want to predict that if you have the DF,

343
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,330
if you remember uh we had the DF encoded, what was the encoded one.

344
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,399
It was the one that we, um, kind of took care of the numerical variable.

345
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,810
And the categorical variable is standardize it and return to categorical into numerical.

346
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:25,630
So it wants to drop the lone status and keep them as x c this way.

347
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:31,540
And put the that one that is drop. This is the loner status as the only one that we want to predict.

348
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,790
That's why. So we want to predict Y based on a lot of variables in the x.

349
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,350
So that's the first um separation. Then you split to the training and testing.

350
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,000
So we have x and y and each of them is going to be split right.

351
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,080
So this is the function um, the one that you've adopted from the top.

352
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,330
So it's split into training and testing. Which one is can be only one x or no.

353
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:03,850
We have x and y both of them. And it chose to go with 80% for uh to uh training.

354
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,679
And then it says test size is 0.2. Means is 20% of the data.

355
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,280
Is the testing point random tested 42 is a random number.

356
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,879
You don't need to you can you always use this or any other integer is for um, the um randomization terms.

357
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,110
Um, because it randomly is going to split to 80 and 40, uh 80 and 20.

358
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:27,370
Right. The last part is going to spit out uh shape of the X train.

359
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,079
And we're going to have a chance to check how many rows and columns it should be properly done.

360
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,489
And it's pretty much obvious that it's going to be like that. So, uh, we're going to do it one by one.

361
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:45,430
Let's accept and run it and you get the result. Okay. Shape of X train is going to be 36,000 rows in the X for training.

362
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,150
And 9000 rows are kept for testing.

363
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,900
And they have 22 columns. If you remember we had a total of 22.

364
00:33:53,350 --> 00:34:00,340
Um, and one column is not there because that's the Y train and Y test, right?

365
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:10,390
Again, the 36,000 goes with this one, um, which are both of them for training and and also testing is 9000 remains as the X's and Y's.

366
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,510
You don't see anything here. But that means that there's only one which is the, um, your target variable there.

367
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:24,009
Excellent. Let's go. Split the data set. Um, we did this with it is said that's more than the training based on logistic regression.

368
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,350
So from the same math from scikit learn, it imports logistic regression.

369
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:34,360
Again if you want uh, I will come back to and and explain a couple of codes more if you want to.

370
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,690
But you can always press on explain to get a sense of that.

371
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:48,160
So it brings in logistic regression and it develops a model how this develops uh, and it pushes that a model and then say okay fit do the fit.

372
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:52,630
Oh look at the y um, target variable.

373
00:34:52,660 --> 00:35:01,360
Look at many axes here and try to fit a model that explain Y's with all this X's with the best way possible.

374
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,510
We don't need to know how, but that's the way it does. Let's run it.

375
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,480
I going run it. Develop tomorrow.

376
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:14,700
It doesn't show you anything here, but you're going to see in the next part that we're going to start testing, right.

377
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,749
Um, so let's wait for it. Um, so it's done.

378
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:26,879
So there is a model that is being trained and it has fitted, um, y on X is all X is on the Y, and we'll see how it goes.

379
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,230
Okay. Now is the time for evaluation for evaluation of the model.

380
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,130
Now we want to see the prediction. How do we evaluate. So what we do.

381
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,030
You remember that we kept 20% of the data as the test data okay.

382
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,070
So we get their x port which is the X of the test.

383
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:52,260
We give it to our model and say hey model predicts device and put it recorded in y produced.

384
00:35:52,410 --> 00:36:00,330
So this function comes and put all the x's of the test part that day that the the train it has not been used in,

385
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,170
in the training and asked the model to the model that it evolved to predict the what.

386
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,350
And then you get the boy and compare the with the Y test, which is the real one.

387
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:16,590
Right. Um, real decisions that we made in the past in those, uh, part in that part of the data set.

388
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,270
So Aladdin it is spits out the first ten predicted loan statuses.

389
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,840
It also shows the first set. Just want to show us, uh, okay.

390
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,340
Let's do that. So it shows this this is my prediction for the first ten.

391
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,840
I mean I would either include this or you can delete it, but it's okay. Um, so what is the next.

392
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,740
Now we want to see what is a good prediction or not.

393
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,810
But anyways we have all the I think it was 9000. How many was 9000 rows.

394
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,170
Now we have created and we want to go and predict. Excellent.

395
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,060
We want to do the prediction. Um, let me make it simple.

396
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,290
Um, for you all do to make it simple after and I'll tell you why.

397
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,490
But these are some of the functions is important.

398
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,050
Um, I don't want all of them, but let me make it simple and the transform and let me do it later.

399
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,220
I'm worried that it kind of make a mess with our, uh, with our.

400
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,600
We are changing because this is the last stage. I'll come back and change it after.

401
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,399
Actually, it's good because I can. I can show you how to change the codes, but it brings in a lot of, uh, functions.

402
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,730
But let's focus only on this one. Accuracy score. That's what I need.

403
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,719
How accurate is my prediction? How does it work? Calculate accuracy.

404
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:34,020
So accuracy is you have compare y test and y prediction.

405
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,890
So your y prediction is what you predicted based on the model you develop.

406
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,910
And y test is the real Y that you in the past that was the decision on.

407
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:50,489
We assumed that was a good decision. So we're going to compare it. Um, uh 100% means the prediction of our model is exactly as we predicted.

408
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,670
Ourself as humans or department has made those decisions.

409
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,200
And then is um, they do the, uh, prediction.

410
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,790
Uh, let's just skip the precision and the other ones, um, and run it.

411
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:10,769
And then we look at this number and the rest of them, I'll explain it to you after, uh, but I want you to just see this.

412
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,179
Oh, that's a very good number is 80.89%.

413
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,360
Let's say 90% is the accuracy.

414
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,340
Um, then we ask it because it's almost done. But I want to make sense of this.

415
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,520
You don't need to interpret this. I'm going to talk about these later.

416
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,569
These are important. But it gives you a summary. Uh, this look at the summary.

417
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,450
But it says the data set was split into this and that.

418
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:39,840
Since we went through this, the model achieved an accuracy of almost 90%, which is which is a big deal.

419
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,790
Let me ask you a question. Um, number one, before that, let me tell you.

420
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,000
Imagine you run this and you don't like it if you want to change it, okay.

421
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,490
You want to come here. You remember. Explain the code. You may transform code.

422
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,090
You don't want to change it, but give it a feedback. I need to simplify.

423
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,200
This and only half accuracy score.

424
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,600
Revise it. Okay, let's do it.

425
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,980
Let's see if age revises that.

426
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,460
And it gives us with green and red. Okay.

427
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,620
Excellent. These are the ones that is highlighted by red means that I'm going to delete that.

428
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:26,200
The ones that are green means that I'm going to add that right. Some of them that are not colored means they're going to stay as it should only print.

429
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,170
The accuracy remains. And as you may see, I'm going to go and rerun it.

430
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,420
You see that it becomes a smaller. And then we have the same number. So the accuracy is this.

431
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,000
Tell me what the accuracy means.

432
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:58,660
Okay, so it tells us what is the accuracy in the context of a classification model like the one we built to predict loan status accuracy?

433
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:05,450
I'm reading here actually season metric that tells you the proportion of total predictions that are correct,

434
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:16,850
which means almost 90% of the prediction of this model was accurate was exactly similar to what our deportment back in time sat down and decided on.

435
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,150
That's right. So that's quite important. And that's the explanation of that.

436
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,620
Okay, I'll stop here.
