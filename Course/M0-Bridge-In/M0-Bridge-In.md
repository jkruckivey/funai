```markdown
# Why AI Literacy Matters for Business Leaders

Artificial intelligence is no longer confined to tech companies or R&D labs—it's embedded in organizational decision-making across every industry. Banks use algorithms to approve loans. Courts use risk scores to determine bail. Hospitals use triage systems to allocate care. HR departments use resume screening tools to identify candidates.

**As a business leader, you will encounter AI in three critical roles:**

**1. Strategic Decision-Maker: Should We Adopt AI?**

Your organization will face AI implementation decisions. Vendors will pitch solutions promising 90%+ accuracy, cost savings, and efficiency gains. You need the literacy to ask critical questions:
- What data was used to train this model?
- How was accuracy measured, and across which demographic groups?
- What happens when the algorithm encounters edge cases not in training data?
- Who is accountable when predictions are wrong?

Without technical understanding, you risk adopting systems that automate bias, create legal liability, or fail to deliver promised value.

**2. Governance Leader: How Do We Use AI Responsibly?**

Once deployed, AI systems require ongoing oversight. You'll need to evaluate:
- Are error rates disproportionately affecting certain customer segments?
- When should humans override algorithmic recommendations?
- How do we ensure transparency and explainability for affected individuals?
- What monitoring processes prevent algorithmic drift over time?

Effective governance requires understanding how ML models work, where bias enters, and what fairness metrics reveal.

**3. Ethical Steward: What Are the Consequences?**

AI systems amplify existing patterns in data—including historical discrimination. An algorithm trained on biased lending decisions perpetuates that bias at scale. As a leader, you must:
- Recognize when "accurate" predictions mask unfair outcomes
- Balance efficiency gains against societal harms
- Navigate competing stakeholder interests (shareholders, customers, regulators, employees)
- Advocate for responsible AI practices even when they reduce short-term profitability

**This Course Builds AI Literacy Through Action, Not Just Theory**

You won't just read case studies about AI—you'll build a machine learning model yourself. You'll experience the decisions that shape algorithmic outcomes: which data to include, how to handle outliers, what accuracy threshold is "good enough." You'll then analyze a real case where these decisions led to controversy over algorithmic bias in courtrooms.

By experiencing ML development hands-on, you'll develop the technical literacy to evaluate AI systems critically, govern them responsibly, and deploy them ethically throughout your career.

**The goal isn't to make you a data scientist—it's to transform you from an AI consumer into an AI-literate business leader who can shape how organizations design, deploy, and govern intelligent systems.**

Let's begin your journey.

You've completed the bridge-in module! You now understand:

✅ **Why AI literacy matters** for business leaders in strategic, governance, and ethical roles

✅ **Course structure** across six modules from ML fundamentals to implementation challenges

✅ **Learning journey** connecting hands-on development to real-world bias case studies

✅ **Your starting point** through the diagnostic AI conversation

✅ **Time commitment** (~10 hours with flexible pacing)

**Up Next: Module 1 - What is AI and Its Types**

In the next module, you'll move from theory to practice. You'll open Google Colab, load a dataset with 45,000 loan applications, and build a logistic regression model that predicts approvals with 89% accuracy.

This hands-on experience reveals the decisions that shape ML outcomes—decisions that, in high-stakes contexts, determine who gets loans, jobs, bail, and medical care.
